# MineChunks
MineChunks is a simple plugin to laod chunks on a per player basis. It allows a player to define chunks in which will remain loaded so that they either do not need to be online or furthermore can do other stuff away from the loaded chunks, instead of manually needing to keep the chunks loaded.

This therefore eliminates the need for random minecraft accounts to keep chunks loaded.
